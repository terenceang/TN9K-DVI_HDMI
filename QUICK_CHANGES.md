# Quick Optimization Reference

## Key Changes Made

### 1. tmds_encoder.vhd
✅ Changed bit counting from loop to parallel tree addition  
✅ Reduced disparity counter from 8-bit to 6-bit (signed)  
✅ Changed integer ranges to explicit unsigned(3:0)  
✅ Removed unused tracking signals (data_island_prev, de_prev)  
✅ Updated all disparity calculations to use 6-bit signed arithmetic  

### 2. test_pattern_gen.vhd
✅ Replaced division by 80 with bit slicing: `h_count(9 downto 7)`  
✅ Replaced 8-way case statement with simple bit inversion  
✅ Pre-computed sync timing constants (H_SYNC_START, etc.)  
✅ Removed BAR_WIDTH constant (no longer needed)  

### 3. hdmi_encoder.vhd
✅ Removed unnecessary ctrl_r and ctrl_g signals  
✅ Made Red/Green ctrl inputs constant "00"  
✅ Removed syn_preserve and syn_keep attributes  

### 4. tn9k_hdmi_video_top.vhd
✅ Removed all syn_keep attributes from debug signals  

## Expected Savings
- **LUTs**: ~100-180 reduction (mostly from test pattern generator)
- **Registers**: ~12-16 reduction
- **Overall Logic**: ~35-40% reduction expected

## Build & Test
1. Open project in Gowin IDE
2. Synthesize (check resource report)
3. Place & Route
4. Program Tang Nano 9K
5. Verify HDMI output displays color bars correctly
